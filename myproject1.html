<h4><P>A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things were so hard for her. 
She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up She was tired of fighting and struggling.
It seemed as one problem was solved, a new one arose.</P> 

<P>Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire.
Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed ground coffee beans.
She let them sit and boil; without saying a word.</P> 
<P>In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners.
She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. 
Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see."
<i>"Carrots, eggs, and coffee,"</i> she replied. Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots.
She did and noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg and break it. 
 After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee. 
The daughter smiled, as she tasted its rich aroma the daughter then asked, "What does it mean, mother?"</P> <P>Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity:
boiling water. Each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting.
However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak.
The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after sitting through the boiling water, its insides became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however.
After they were in the boiling water, they had changed the water.</p><p><b><em>"Which are you?"</em></b><!--bold tag apply here--> she asked her daughter.
      
<em>"When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond?</em><!--emphasis tag is apply here--> Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean? <em>Think of this: Which am I?</em>
Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength?
Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat? 
Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff?
Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart? 
Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain.
When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavor.</p>
<P>If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you.
When the hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate yourself to another level? How do you handle adversity?</P>
              
<em>Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?</em>
The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their ways.

<p>"Hello world" My name is ALEGBELEYE AYODEJI PAUL, I just wanted to make a reference to what i learned on Hypertext Markup Language
  (HTML) through PIRPLE FRONTEND FUNDAMENTALS. Html is simple when one create an interest, full attention and concentration toward it.
  I started my learning from introduction to html, which comprises of doctype, head, title, and body e.t.c. All this are  the major container
  of the html that allow the code to display on wedsite properly. then, i moved further to learned about lists, images, links and some other
   html tags.
  But one thing i always do and that i also think is necessary for all the learner to do is Personal Research, i always do go online to make
   a research, there,
   i learned so many other things that i was not thought in the class.</p> 
   <p>How did my code works? My code works because it was coded right, if the code was not coded in a right way, it will not be display on the 
     wedsite and their are tags that were single tags and some were closing tags, all this are needed to be observed and noted </p>
